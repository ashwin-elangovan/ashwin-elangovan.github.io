### Personal Website

This portfolio is built on GatsbyJS, so it comes with all the benefits of it. You can make use of the thousands of Gatsby Plugins, utilize the Gatsby APIs (SSR, Browser, etc), and much more. For more information, check out [their great docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).

### Adding or Updating Pages

The pages for the template exist in `src/pages` and are simply React components that get treated as pages by GatsbyJS. By default, the following pages exist in the template:

- `src/pages/index.jsx` - the main homepage
- `src/pages/blog.jsx` - the main `/blog` homepage
- `src/pages/404.jsx` - the default 404 page

### Adding or Updating Styles

This is fully styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with the exception of a couple minor additional styles, as found in `src/css/index.css`.
